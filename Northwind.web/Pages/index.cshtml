@functions
{
    public string? DayName {get; set;}
    public void OnGet()
    {
        ViewData["Title"] = "Northwind B2B";

    }
}
@* When you define properties in the functions block, you are writing an auto-generated class named Pages_<razorPageName>. 
    That class has a property named Model that represents itself (seems a bit circular but OK). 
    You can refer to the properties specified in functions with @YourProperty @this.YourProperty or @Model.YourProperty*@
